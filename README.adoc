To build and run `make` to build the engine. Alternatively you can just
navigate to the releases page and download the RocketEngine zip.

== Use Intructions

Once downloaded, to use the library in your project add the include path
to you command when building the .o files then to build to final
executable include the path to the librryr and link the library

=== Example

`psp-g++ -I/home/me/path/to/RocketEngine/include -I. -I/home/me/path/to/pspsdk/psp/sdk/include -std=c++14 -fno-rtti $(YOUR_FLAGS_HERE) -D_PSP_FW_VERSION=600 -c -o file.o file.cpp`

`psp-gcc -I/home/me/path/to/RocketEngine/include -I. -I/home/me/path/to/pspsdk/psp/sdk/include -D_PSP_FW_VERSION=600  -L. -L/home/me/path/to/pspsdk/psp/sdk/lib -specs=/home/me/path/to/pspsdk/psp/sdk/lib/prxspecs -Wl,-q,-T/home/me/path/to/pspsdk/psp/sdk/lib/linkfile.prx -L/home/me/path/to/RocketEngine  file.o ... -lrocket_engine -lstdc++ -lm $(other_libs) -o Tutorial.elf`

Note the order of `-lrocket_engine -lstdc++ -lm`. Since rocket_engine leverages code from `-lstdc++ -lm` it is important that the order is maintained.
